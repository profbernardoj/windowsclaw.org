# Finance.md — Asset Tracking

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     Your portfolio tracker. Update holdings manually; prices are
     refreshed automatically by the x402 finance tracker cron job.
     
     To add a token: add it to the HOLDINGS object in 
     scripts/finance-tracker-x402.mjs AND add a row to this table.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

## Growth Catalysts

<!-- What could move the needle? List the events, projects, or market
     conditions that would meaningfully change your portfolio value.
     
     Example:
     ### 1. Project Launch
     Token X launching mainnet in Q2 — expecting 5-10x from current.
     
     ### 2. Market Cycle
     BTC halving effects historically peak 12-18 months post-event. -->

---

## Price History

<!-- The finance tracker appends daily snapshots here automatically.
     Format:
     ### YYYY-MM-DD
     - TOKEN: $PRICE (▲/▼ X%)
     - ...
-->

---

## Notes

<!-- Any additional context: where assets are held, vesting schedules,
     tax considerations, etc. -->

  Cyclic shift execution engine. Plans tasks 3x daily (6 AM, 2 PM, 10 PM),
  decomposes them into granular steps, then executes via 15-minute cron cycles.
  Each cycle reads state files, picks the next step, executes it, writes results back.
  Errors are logged and skipped — never fatal. Planning uses Claude 4.6; execution uses GLM-5.
version: 2.0.0

# Three Shifts v2 — Cyclic Execution Engine

**Architecture:** Plan once → decompose → execute in 15-minute cycles → each cycle does ONE step → state persists in files between runs.

**Why v2:** V1 ran everything in one long session. One timeout killed the whole shift. V2 is a state machine — errors get logged, skipped, and retried. 32 cycles per shift, each learning from the last.

## File Structure

All state lives in `workspace/shifts/`:

### tasks.md Format

```markdown
# Afternoon Shift — 2026-02-22
Approved by: owner | Approved at: 2:15 PM CST
Shift window: 2:00 PM – 10:00 PM CST
Cycles remaining: ~30

## Task 1: Morpheus Gateway transition plan [P1]
- [x] Step 1.1: Read current proxy-router config and session economics — DONE (cycle 1)
- [ ] Step 1.2: Research mor-gateway paid tier pricing and limits
- [!] Step 1.3: Compare cost of paid tier vs local-only — BLOCKED: need pricing from step 1.2
- [ ] Step 1.4: Draft transition recommendation in memory/projects/morpheus/

## Task 2: Commit workspace changes [P1]
- [ ] Step 2.1: Run git status, identify logical commit groups
- [ ] Step 2.2: Stage and commit new skills (three-shifts, relationships)
- [ ] Step 2.3: Stage and commit memory reorganization files
- [ ] Step 2.4: Stage and commit scripts and config changes
- [ ] Step 2.5: Push to remote

## Summary
Total steps: 9 | Done: 1 | Blocked: 1 | Remaining: 7
Last cycle: 2026-02-22 14:15 CST — completed step 1.1
Next target: Step 1.2
```

**Step markers:**
- `[ ]` — Not started (available for next cycle)
- `[x]` — Completed (with cycle number and brief result)
- `[!]` — Blocked (with reason — will be retried after dependencies clear)
- `[~]` — In progress (claimed by current cycle, prevents double-execution)
- `[-]` — Skipped (manually removed or deprioritized)

### context.md Format

```markdown
# Shift Context — Living Document

## Stack & Environment
- macOS arm64, OpenClaw 2026.2.21-2
- Git repos: ~/.openclaw/workspace, ~/morpheus
- 1Password for secrets (never store raw keys)
- Signal for user comms

## Constraints
- Never force push or delete branches
- trash > rm (recoverable beats gone)
- Space Brave searches by 2+ seconds (rate limit)
- MiniMax-M2.5: DO NOT USE (broken streaming)
- Llama 3.3 70B: DO NOT USE

## Known Pitfalls (learned from experience)
- Morpheus session_id and model_id must be HTTP headers, not JSON body
- signal-cli drops connections periodically — not actionable, just retry
- Venice billing cooldown: 1 hour per key on 402
- Always check git status before committing — avoid partial commits

## Rules for This Shift
- Night shift: no external comms, no financial txns, no destructive ops
- If blocked on user input, skip and note in handoff
- Max 1 web search per cycle (Brave rate limit)
```

## Shifts

| Shift | Plan Cron | Cycle Crons | Window | Character |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Morning | 6:00 AM | 6:15 AM – 1:45 PM (every 15 min) | 6 AM – 2 PM | Comms, decisions, user-facing |
| Afternoon | 2:00 PM | 2:15 PM – 9:45 PM (every 15 min) | 2 PM – 10 PM | Deep work, building, coding |
| Night | 10:00 PM | 10:15 PM – 5:45 AM (every 15 min) | 10 PM – 6 AM | Autonomous, research, maintenance |

---

## Phase 1: Planning (runs once per shift)

**Model:** `venice/claude-opus-4-6` (heavy model for quality planning)

When the planning cron fires:

### 1. Gather Context

Read these sources:
- `shifts/handoff.md` — what last shift left behind
- `shifts/context.md` — rules, constraints, pitfalls
- `shifts/state.json` — previous shift stats
- `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — today's activity
- `MEMORY.md` — active projects, priorities, deadlines
- Calendar (if available) — meetings in shift window
- Email (if available) — urgent unreads
- Git status of active repos

### 2. Check for Carryover

If `shifts/tasks.md` has incomplete `[ ]` or `[!]` steps from a previous shift:
- Carry them forward into the new plan automatically
- Mark them as `[carryover]` in the new plan
- Night shift: if ALL remaining items were approved in morning/afternoon, auto-approve (no user ping needed)

### 3. Generate Shift Plan

Present to user in this format:

```
☀️/🌤️/🌙 [SHIFT] SHIFT PLAN
Date: [DATE] | Window: [START]–[END] [TZ]
Exec model: GLM-5 | Cycles: ~32

P1 (Must do):
1. [Task] — [Est. time] — [Why now]
2. ...

P2 (Should do):
3. ...

P3 (Could do):
5. ...

Blocked/Waiting:
- [Item] — [Blocker]

Carryover from last shift:
- [Item] — [Status]

Reply: "Approve" / "Approve all" / "Approve 1,3" / "Add: [task]" / "Skip"
```

### 4. On Approval — Auto-Decompose

This is the critical v2 step. After approval, **before any execution begins:**

1. Take each approved task and break it into **atomic steps** that GLM-5 can execute in a single cycle (~10-12 minutes of work max per step)
2. Each step must be:
   - **Self-contained:** Can be done without remembering previous cycles
   - **Verifiable:** Has a clear "done" condition
   - **Small:** One file edit, one command, one search, one commit — not five things
   - **Context-light:** The step description + context.md should be enough; no conversation history needed
3. Write the decomposed plan to `shifts/tasks.md`
4. Initialize `shifts/state.json`
5. Start the cycle cron (or let the existing every-15-min cron pick it up)

**Decomposition guidelines for GLM-5:**
- Prefer explicit commands over abstract instructions ("Run `git status` in ~/morpheus" not "check the repo")
- Include file paths, command snippets, expected outputs where possible
- If a step requires a decision, split it: "Research X" → "Write recommendation to file" → separate step for user to review
- Max 3 tool calls per step (keeps GLM-5 focused)
- If a task has >8 steps, split it into two tasks

### 5. Night Shift Auto-Approve

If it's 10 PM and:
- `shifts/tasks.md` has incomplete steps from today's morning or afternoon shifts
- Those steps were already approved by the user earlier today
- No new tasks need approval

Then:
- Auto-approve the carryover items
- Skip the user ping
- Write `"nightAutoApproved": true` to state.json
- Begin cycling immediately
- Do NOT add new P1/P2 tasks without user approval (P3 autonomous tasks like cleanup/memory are OK)

### User Approval Flow

When the user responds to a shift plan:

**"Approve" / "Approve all":**
1. Read `shifts/state.json` — confirm status is `awaiting_approval`
2. Set `status` to `"executing"`, `approvedAt` to current ISO timestamp, `approvedBy to "owner"`
3. Write updated state.json
4. The next cycle executor cron (every 15 min) will pick it up automatically

**"Add: [task]":**
1. Decompose the new task into atomic steps (same rules as planning phase)
2. Append the new steps to `shifts/tasks.md`
3. Update `totalSteps` in state.json
4. Then approve (set status to `"executing"`)

**"Skip":**
1. Set `status` to `"cancelled"` in state.json
2. Write a note in `shifts/handoff.md` that the shift was skipped

**No response after 30 minutes (morning/afternoon):**
- The planning cron already delivered the plan. If no approval comes, cycles will no-op (status stays `awaiting_approval`)
- Next shift's planner will carry forward any planned tasks

---

## Phase 2: Cycle Execution (runs every 15 minutes)

**Model:** `mor-gateway/glm-5` (light model, cost-efficient)

Each cycle is an **isolated session** — no memory of previous cycles except what's in the files.

### Cycle Algorithm

```
1. READ shifts/state.json
   → If status is "completed", "cancelled", "idle", or "awaiting_approval": reply HEARTBEAT_OK (no-op)
   → If status is "executing": continue

2. READ shifts/tasks.md
   → Find first step marked [ ] (not started)
   → If none found, check for [!] (blocked) steps — retry if dependency cleared
   → If all steps are [x], [-], or still [!]: shift is DONE → go to Handoff

3. READ shifts/context.md
   → Load rules, constraints, pitfalls

4. CHECK FOR STALE CLAIMS
   → If any step is marked [~] (claimed by a previous cycle that crashed/timed out):
     - Change it back to [ ] — the previous cycle didn't finish
     - This step becomes the next available step to claim

5. CLAIM the step
   → Mark it [~] (in progress) in tasks.md
   → Write current timestamp to state.json

6. EXECUTE the step
   → Do the work (one focused action)
   → Stay within the step's scope — do NOT drift to other tasks

7. WRITE RESULTS back to tasks.md
   → Success: [x] Step N.N: description — DONE (cycle X): brief result
   → Blocked: [!] Step N.N: description — BLOCKED (cycle X): reason why
   → If blocked, check if next [ ] step has no dependency on this one → continue to it

8. UPDATE state.json
   → Increment cyclesRun, update completed/blocked counts, lastCycleAt

9. UPDATE shifts/context.md (if learned something new)
   → New pitfall discovered? Add it.
   → Found a useful command? Note it.
   → This is how cycles teach future cycles.

10. IF time permits in this cycle, take the NEXT available [ ] step
   → But only if the current step took <5 minutes
   → Never take more than 2 steps per cycle
```

### Cycle Rules

- **One step at a time.** Don't try to be clever and batch.
- **Errors are data, not failures.** Log the error, mark blocked, move on.
- **Never ask the user mid-cycle.** If you need user input, mark blocked and note what's needed.
- **Stay in scope.** The step says "commit skill files" — don't also refactor the README.
- **Update context.md with lessons.** This is how you teach the next cycle.
- **Respect quiet hours.** Night cycles: no Signal messages, no external comms.
- **Max 2 steps per cycle.** Leave time for the next cycle to start clean.

### Handling Blocks

When a step is blocked:
1. Mark it `[!]` with a clear reason
2. Check if the block is:
   - **Dependency block** (step 3 needs step 2's output): Skip, will retry when step 2 clears
   - **User block** (needs owner's input): Note in handoff, skip
   - **External block** (API down, service unavailable): Retry next cycle automatically
   - **Error block** (command failed): Log error in context.md, retry with different approach next cycle
3. Move to the next available `[ ]` step
4. Blocked steps get re-evaluated each cycle — if the blocker resolves, they become available again

### Handling Retries

If a `[!]` step has been blocked for 3+ cycles:
1. Write a note in context.md about the persistent failure
2. Check if there's an alternative approach
3. If the step has failed 5+ times, mark it `[-]` (skipped) and note in handoff for user review

---

## Phase 3: Handoff (automatic when shift ends)

When all steps are `[x]`, `[-]`, or `[!]`, OR when the shift window expires:

1. **Archive the shift:**
   - Copy `shifts/tasks.md` → `shifts/history/YYYY-MM-DD-{shift}.md`
   - Include final state.json data as YAML frontmatter

2. **Write handoff.md:**
```markdown
# Handoff: Afternoon → Night | 2026-02-22

## Completed
- Task 1: Morpheus transition plan — recommendation written to memory/projects/morpheus/
- Task 2 steps 1-3: Workspace commits (skills, memory reorg)

## Still In Progress
- Task 2 steps 4-5: Script commits and push (2 steps remaining)

## Blocked (needs user)
- Task 1 step 3: Need pricing confirmation for mor-gateway paid tier

## Lessons Learned This Shift
- GLM-5 handles git operations well but struggles with multi-file diffs
- Brave search rate limit hit on cycle 4 — added 3-second delay to context.md

## Recommendations for Next Shift
- Finish Task 2 push (quick, 1 cycle)
- Review Morpheus recommendation in memory/projects/morpheus/transition.md
```

3. **Update state.json:** Set status to "completed"

4. **Update daily log:** Append shift summary to `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

5. **Notify user** (morning/afternoon only): Brief summary via Signal
   - Night shift: write summary but don't ping until morning planning cron

## Configuration

See `references/config.md` for:
- Customizing shift times
- Weekend behavior
- Quiet hours
- Task categories and safety rules

---

## Safety Rules

### Always OK (any shift, any cycle)
- Reading files, git status, web search
- Writing to workspace files (tasks.md, context.md, memory/)
- Running non-destructive commands

### Requires Approval (via shift plan, not mid-cycle)
- Sending emails, messages, social posts
- Creating PRs, pushing code
- Financial transactions

### Never During Night Shift Cycles
- External communications (Signal, email, social)
- Financial transactions
- Destructive operations (rm, force push, branch delete)
- Security changes (key rotation, permissions)
- New tasks not already approved

### Cycle-Specific Safety
- Never take more than 2 steps per cycle
- Never exceed 12 minutes of execution per step
- If a step seems dangerous, mark it `[!] NEEDS_REVIEW` instead of executing
- Never modify context.md to remove safety rules
- Never modify this SKILL.md during a cycle

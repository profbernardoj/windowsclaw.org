# Shift Context — Living Document

<!-- This file persists across cycles and shifts. Update it with lessons learned,
     constraints, and rules. Each cycle reads this for context. -->

## Stack & Environment
- <!-- Your OS, OpenClaw version -->
- <!-- Git repos and their locations -->
- <!-- Secret management approach (1Password, Keychain, etc.) -->
- <!-- Primary messaging channel -->

## Constraints
- Never force push or delete branches
- trash > rm (recoverable beats gone)
- <!-- Add rate limits for any APIs you use -->
- <!-- Add any model-specific limitations -->

## Known Pitfalls (learned from experience)
- <!-- Add gotchas as you discover them -->
- <!-- Each cycle can append new pitfalls here -->

## Rules for This Shift
- Night shift: no external comms, no financial txns, no destructive ops
- If blocked on user input, skip and note in handoff

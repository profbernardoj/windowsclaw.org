# EverClaw Changelog

All notable changes to EverClaw are documented here.

## [2026.3.31] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Backup & Restore System** — Comprehensive disaster recovery with AGE-encrypted backups
  - `everclaw-export.mjs` (781 lines) — Encrypted backup creation with Docker support
  - `everclaw-restore.mjs` (1131 lines) — Restore with pre-restore backup and rollback
  - `everclaw-verify.mjs` (924 lines) — Standalone health verification utility
  - `everclaw-migrate.mjs` (926 lines) — Interactive migration wizard
- **lib/morpheus.mjs extensions**:
  - `getMorpheusConfig()` — Parse .env and config files
  - `getMorpheusSession()` — Get session ID, address, cookie
  - `checkMorpheusHealth()` — API health check via /health or /v1/models
- **Docker volume streaming** — Stream backup/restore directly from/to containers without intermediate files
- **Wallet safety** — Address confirmation required for wallet restore (user must type full address)
- **GLM-5 inference test** — Post-restore verification confirms working inference via Morpheus endpoint
- **Auto-rollback** — `--rollback auto` detects and restores from latest pre-restore backup
- **Migration state tracking** — `~/.everclaw/migration-state.json` tracks in-progress migrations

### Security
- **AGE encryption** — All backups encrypted with user-supplied passphrase (AES-256-GCM)
- **Wallet double-encryption** — Wallet key encrypted separately inside the archive
- **Shred on exit** — Staging directory securely deleted after restore
- **Pre-restore backup** — Automatic safety backup before any restore operation

### Documentation
- **SKILL.md Section 22** — Full backup/restore documentation with CLI reference
- **Quick Reference** — Added backup/restore commands
- **Version** — Bumped to 2026.3.31

## [2026.3.27.1707] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Docker VOLUME overlay bug on first run** — Default config template was baked into `/home/node/.openclaw/`, which gets hidden by Barney's auto-mounted empty persistent volume, causing `cp: cannot stat` and container exit. Moved template to `/opt/everclaw/defaults/` (outside any VOLUME) so it survives empty mount overlays.

## [2026.3.27.0434] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Docker build heredoc syntax** — Heredoc (`<< 'EOF'`) doesn't work in Dockerfile without BuildKit frontend directive. Replaced with `COPY config/openclaw-default.json` approach.
- **Gitleaks false positives** — Secret scanner flagged 256 false positives (public contract addresses, example API keys, test fixtures). Added `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist with proper TOML syntax.
- **Wallet tests in CI** — Interactive confirmation prompts (`CONFIRM SWAP?`, `CONFIRM APPROVE?`) caused 10 test failures in CI (no stdin). Added `CI_NON_INTERACTIVE` flag auto-approves when `EVERCLAW_YES=1` or `CI=true`.
- **Smoke test script path** — Container path was wrong (`scripts/setup.mjs` vs `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/setup.mjs`).

### Added
- **config/openclaw-default.json** — Standalone config file for Docker COPY (replaces embedded heredoc).
- **.gitleaks.toml** — Allowlist for public values, example keys, test fixtures, docs paths.

## [2026.3.27] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Docker VOLUME declarations for Barney + persistent storage** — Barney VM platform auto-detects `VOLUME` instructions in Dockerfile and attaches 20 GB persistent storage. Without these, container restarts lose all memories, configs, wallet keys, and sessions. Changes:
  - Added `VOLUME ["/home/node/.openclaw", "/home/node/.morpheus", "/home/node/.everclaw"]` to Dockerfile
  - Added `.everclaw` directory creation in Dockerfile (for wallet.enc)
  - Added `chmod 700 /home/node/.everclaw` for wallet security hardening
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to mount all three volumes for local Docker parity
  - Updated Dockerfile header comment with full `docker run -v` example
- **Memories, configs, wallet keys, and proxy sessions now survive container updates** — previously all ephemeral on restart

### Fixed
- **Cookie path bug in morpheus-proxy.mjs** — Script was reading cookie from `~/morpheus/.cookie` (wrong) instead of `~/.morpheus/.cookie` (correct). Container would fail to reuse existing sessions even with volume mounted. Fixed line 27 to use correct path.

## [2026.3.26.0037] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **OpenClaw upgraded from v2026.3.23 to v2026.3.24** — Security and reliability improvements:
  - **Security fix (#54034):** Sandbox media dispatch alias bypass closed — prevents escaping media-root restrictions
  - **Docker fix (#53385):** Pre-start namespace loop fixed for fresh Docker installs — directly benefits EverClaw container deployments
  - **Gateway /v1/models endpoint:** OpenAI-compatible routing improvement — better client compatibility for gateway-only installs
  - **Restart sentinel (#53940):** Post-restart session wake uses heartbeat with retry — improves reliability after config changes
  - **Channel boot isolation (#54215):** Broken channel no longer blocks others from starting — improves multi-channel reliability
  - **CLI --container flag:** New flag for running commands inside Docker/Podman containers
  - License unchanged: MIT (Peter Steinberger)
- **Dockerfile** — `OPENCLAW_VERSION` bumped from `v2026.3.23` to `v2026.3.24`

## [2026.3.25.1358] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Docker container crash on first-run** — OpenClaw v2026.3.13+ strict schema validation rejects `_`-prefixed comment keys (`_note`, `_morpheusNote`) in the default config, causing the gateway to exit fatally before reaching inference. Tester-reported: container starts, scaffolds workspace files, then crashes with "Config invalid / Unrecognized key" errors.
  - Removed `_note` from `morpheus-local` provider in Dockerfile embedded default
  - Removed `_morpheusNote` from `agents.defaults` in Dockerfile embedded default
  - Removed `_morpheusNote` from `templates/openclaw-config-gateway-only.json`
  - Removed `_note` and `_morpheusNote` from `templates/openclaw-config-mac.json`
  - Removed `_note` and `_morpheusNote` from `templates/openclaw-config-linux.json`
- **Native installer also affected** — `setup.mjs` `stripComments()` only stripped `_comment` keys, not `_note` or `_morpheusNote`. Mac/Linux native installs via `setup.mjs` would hit the same crash. Broadened to strip ALL `_`-prefixed keys.

### Added
- **Defensive config sanitizer in Docker entrypoint** — `docker-entrypoint.sh` now runs a jq `walk` strip of all `_`-prefixed keys after config copy, before gateway launch. Prevents this class of bug from ever recurring, even if future template edits accidentally add comment keys.

## [2026.3.23] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **OpenClaw upgraded from v2026.3.13-1 to v2026.3.22** — Major upstream release with 20+ breaking changes (none affecting EverClaw), security hardening, and performance improvements:
  - ClawHub now preferred over npm for skill installs (benefits EverClaw discovery)
  - Gateway startup: prewarm primary model before channel startup (fixes cold-start first-message failures)
  - Gateway startup: load bundled plugins from compiled dist (faster boot, especially in containers)
  - Stable `memory-cli.js` entry point (fixes memory_search depending on hashed bundle names)
  - Agent default timeout raised from 600s to 48h (EverClaw templates still set 300s explicitly)
  - Exec sandbox: blocks JVM injection, glibc tunable exploitation, .NET hijack
  - Security: blocks remote file:// URLs and UNC paths in media loading
  - Security: fails closed on unresolved Bonjour/DNS-SD endpoints
  - Security: rejects marketplace manifest path traversal
  - Per-agent thinking/reasoning/fast defaults support
  - MiniMax M2.7 and updated GLM catalog metadata
  - License unchanged: MIT (Peter Steinberger)
- **Dockerfile** — `OPENCLAW_VERSION` bumped from `v2026.3.13-1` to `v2026.3.22`
- **SKILL.md** — Version aligned to `2026.3.23.1800` (fix: version-stamp.sh missed this file)

## [2026.3.20.1950] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Docker default config routed to dead local proxy** — The Dockerfile's inline default config set `morpheus-local/glm-5` as primary model, which requires a running local proxy + `MORPHEUS_PROXY_API_KEY`. Most Docker users only have a Gateway API key → proxy fails on startup → every request hits dead endpoint → instant timeout. Fix:
  - Dockerfile default config now uses `mor-gateway/glm-5` as primary (works with just `MORPHEUS_GATEWAY_API_KEY`)
  - `morpheus-local` provider kept as optional (only useful when `MORPHEUS_PROXY_API_KEY` is set)
  - Default config includes `timeoutSeconds: 300` and streaming overrides
  - Entrypoint auto-detects: if primary is `morpheus-local/*` but `MORPHEUS_PROXY_API_KEY` isn't set, swaps to `mor-[REDACTED]/*` equivalent
  - [REDACTED] local proxy now only starts when `MORPHEUS_PROXY_API_KEY` is set (no more scary error on startup)

## [2026.3.20.1823] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Streaming enabled on all models** — Without streaming, OpenClaw waits for the complete response before any data arrives. With [REDACTED] P2P provider discovery taking 30-120s, connections hit timeout. Streaming keeps connections alive once the first token arrives. Fix:
  - Streaming set at `agents.defaults.models["provider/id"].streaming = true` (the correct schema location — OpenClaw's `models.providers.*.models.*` is strict `additionalProperties: false` and rejects unknown keys like `streaming`)
  - All 3 config templates updated with correct streaming overrides
  - `setup.mjs` auto-enables streaming for all discovered models during config merge + removes stale `streaming` from provider model definitions
  - Docker entrypoint auto-patches existing configs at container startup (streaming + timeout)
  - `diagnose.sh` new check A9: flags models missing streaming
  - Credit: Thomas (ClawBox) identified the streaming root cause
- **Docker tag-triggered builds were producing empty tags** — `type=semver` can't parse our 4-part `YYYY.M.DD.HHMM` version format. Replaced with `type=match,pattern=v(.*),group=1`. Tag pushes now also tag `:latest`.
- **Docker workflow `no-cache-filter` deprecation** — Renamed to `no-cache-filters` (plural) to match `docker/build-push-action@v6`

## [2026.3.20.1442] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **"LLM request timed out" on container/[REDACTED] installs** — [REDACTED] Gateway models (GLM-5, gpt-oss-120b) can take 30-120s on first request due to P2P provider discovery. OpenClaw's default timeout was too low, causing immediate timeout errors for [REDACTED] users. Fix:
  - All 3 config templates now set `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds: 300` (5 min)
  - `setup.mjs` auto-enforces minimum 180s timeout during config merge (upgrades low values, preserves user values ≥180s)
  - `diagnose.sh` new check A8: flags `timeoutSeconds < 180` as FAIL with fix instructions
  - Agent boot template (`AGENTS.template.md`) now instructs agents to send a brief acknowledgment ("On it!", "Working on that...") on first message so users aren't left staring at a blank screen

## [2026.3.31] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Installer false-positive dependency reporting on macOS** — Non-admin accounts (family, corporate, school Macs) saw misleading `✓ installed` messages when Homebrew failed silently due to missing sudo access. Fix includes:
  - Early admin pre-check with soft warning + automatic nvm fallback for Node.js (100% Mac compatibility)
  - Real verification after each install (`verify_installed()` helper) instead of unconditional `log_ok`
  - Immediate PATH reload for current script session (`reload_brew_path()` + `hash -r`)
  - Permanent PATH persistence to `~/.zprofile` / `~/.bash_profile` via `persist_brew_path()`
  - Robust Intel Mac support (`/usr/local/bin/brew`) alongside Apple Silicon (`/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`)
  - Localized admin group detection (`admin|administradores|administrator`)
  - nvm fallback with `--lts` for future-proof Node.js installs
  - Soft git warning on non-admin Macs (hints at `xcode-select --install` instead of hard fail)
  - Grok 4.2 final audit: 93/100 — 3 fixes applied (brew version display, soft git warning, header verification)

### Added
- **API key injection via environment variables** — Container entrypoint now accepts `MORPHEUS_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and `MORPHEUS_PROXY_API_KEY` env vars and injects them into the OpenClaw config at startup. `mor-[REDACTED]` is a custom provider not in OpenClaw's auto-detection list, so env vars weren't picked up. Users get a clear warning with signup URL if no AI provider keys are configured.
- **Template placeholder substitution** — Boot templates (IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md) now have `__PLACEHOLDER__` tokens replaced with actual values during first-run scaffold. Supports env vars: `EVERCLAW_AGENT_NAME` (default: EverClaw), `EVERCLAW_USER_NAME` (default: User), `EVERCLAW_USER_DISPLAY_NAME`, `TZ` (default: UTC), `EVERCLAW_DEFAULT_MODEL` (default: glm-5). Previously, placeholders like `__AGENT_NAME__` were copied verbatim.

### Fixed
- **Docker image shipping stale OpenClaw v2026.3.11 instead of v2026.3.13** — GitHub Actions CI workflow had `OPENCLAW_VERSION=v2026.3.11` hardcoded in `build-args`, overriding the Dockerfile. Combined with GHA layer caching, the OpenClaw binary never updated. Fixed by: (1) reading `OPENCLAW_VERSION` from Dockerfile dynamically, (2) adding `no-cache-filter: openclaw-builder` to bust the build cache for the OpenClaw build stage.

## [2026.3.29] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Container crash on first run: "Refusing to bind [REDACTED] to lan without auth"** — Regression from v2026.3.28. The `[REDACTED].auth.mode: "none"` we added to the default template caused the entrypoint to skip token injection (treated `"none"` as "user configured"). Gateway then refused to bind to LAN without auth. Fixed by: (1) removing `auth.mode: "none"` from default template, (2) treating `"none"` as equivalent to empty/unset in the entrypoint — always upgrades to `"token"` mode with auto-generated token.

## [2026.3.28] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **"Disconnected from Gateway" / "Device Identity Required" on container LAN access** — Browsers block `crypto.subtle` on plain HTTP from non-localhost IPs, preventing Ed25519 device keypair generation. The [REDACTED] rejected the WebSocket connect with `DEVICE_IDENTITY_REQUIRED`. Fixed by adding `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth: true` and `allowInsecureAuth: true` across all config paths: Dockerfile default template, all 3 config templates (mac/linux/[REDACTED]), docker-entrypoint.sh jq merges, and setup.mjs safe-merge. Matches upstream OpenClaw issues #11590, #44485, #40812, #44967.
- **Race condition: [REDACTED] could start before config was fully patched** — Added a defensive config verification step in docker-entrypoint.sh that runs AFTER auth injection but BEFORE [REDACTED] start. Forces `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` and `allowInsecureAuth` if missing (respects `OPENCLAW_ENABLE_DEVICE_AUTH=true` env var to opt out).
- **Default config missing `[REDACTED].auth` block** — Added `[REDACTED].auth.mode: "none"` to `openclaw-default.json` so the [REDACTED] has a defined auth state from first read. Entrypoint cleanly upgrades to `"token"` mode.

### Changed
- Bumped OpenClaw from v2026.3.11 to v2026.3.13 (22 security patches + auth fixes for device identity handling)
- All config templates now include both `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` and `allowInsecureAuth` for consistent container/headless support
- `setup.mjs` mergeConfig now propagates `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` and `allowInsecureAuth` from templates (only if user hasn't explicitly set them)

## [2026.3.27] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Gateway startup crash on non-loopback binds (`--bind lan`)** — Now auto-configures `controlUi.allowedOrigins` + `dangerouslyAllowHostHeaderOriginFallback` safely in Docker, config templates, and setup.mjs. Fixes container first-run crash reported by tester.
- **Misleading "✅ EverClaw is ready!" banner** — No longer prints success when [REDACTED] actually crashed. Shows clear "❌ EverClaw failed to start" with actionable fix steps and exits with code 1.
- **ENOENT spam on first run** — Pre-creates `.morpheus/.cookie` and `.morpheus/sessions.json` in both Dockerfile and entrypoint. Eliminates all "Failed to read cookie file" and "Failed to save sessions" warnings.
- **Empty `allowedOrigins: []` edge case** — jq uses length-check instead of `//` coalescing, so an explicit empty array is correctly replaced with defaults.
- **Non-Docker installs** — Added `[REDACTED].controlUi` block to all 3 config templates (linux, mac, [REDACTED]) and safe-merge logic in `setup.mjs`. Bare-metal users now get the same crash protection.
- **Safe config merge** — Docker entrypoint and setup.mjs both preserve user-customized `allowedOrigins` and `dangerouslyAllowHostHeaderOriginFallback` values instead of overwriting.

### Changed
- Linux config template now includes `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth: true` (headless/container environments where device auth flow doesn't work)
- Failure banner shows 3 actionable quick fixes (delete config + restart, check origins, report on GitHub)
- Auto-config log line `🔧 Auto-configured [REDACTED].controlUi for container environment` for transparency

## [2026.3.25] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Bootstrap Micro-Funding System** — Zero-friction onboarding: new users receive 0.0008 ETH + 2.00 USDC on Base mainnet automatically
  - `scripts/bootstrap-client.mjs` (NEW) — Client-side bootstrap with PoW anti-Sybil, machine fingerprint dedup, macOS keychain integration
  - Auto-bootstrap integrated into `scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs` setup flow (1-line, graceful failure)
  - API live at `api.everclaw.xyz` (Vercel + Upstash Redis)
  - X post verification for +1 USDC bonus via Twitter Syndication API
  - 6 verified real transfers on Base mainnet during testing

### Security
- PoW challenge: 6 leading zeros SHA-256, 60s window
- Machine fingerprint deduplication (macOS ioreg → /etc/machine-id → hostname fallback)
- 500 bootstraps/day global cap (atomic Redis Lua)
- Tweet reuse prevention, bonus double-claim prevention
- Partial failure handling (ETH sent but USDC failed → logged to Redis for manual retry)

## [2026.3.24] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **agent-chat v0.2.0** — XMTP transport upgrade for Wire↔Ember interop
  - `src/peers.mjs` (NEW) — Peer registry with relationship-based trust (unknown/stranger/colleague/friend/family), JSON fallback + bagman detection, atomic writes, normalized peer shape
  - `src/paths.mjs` (NEW) — Shared path helpers (single source of truth for all XMTP dirs)
  - `src/agent.mjs` — 3-tier guard adapter: Tier 3 (full V6 + comms-guard), Tier 2 (lenient V6 + rate limit + PII), Tier 1 (plaintext fallback)
  - `src/consent.mjs` — EIP-191 handshake protocol wiring (challenge/sign/verify via comms-guard), auto-discovery, timeout/retry
  - `src/router.mjs` — Tier + relationship-aware dispatch, COMMAND demotion by protocol tier AND relationship, atomic inbox writes
  - `src/bridge.mjs` — Outbound reply blocking (canReply gate), failed/ directory for retry, polling fallback for fs.watch reliability, TTL-based dedup
  - `src/health.mjs` — Message counter export, runtime path resolution
  - `cli.mjs` — `trust-peer` (--as/--name), `peers list/show`, `send` (offline outbox queuing)
  - `config/default.json` — New fields: handshake, discovery, tiers, bridge polling
  - 86 tests (48 existing + 38 new: unit, integration, adversarial)

### Fixed
- **install.sh** — Auto-discovers and installs deps for skills with their own package.json (agent-chat, future skills)
- **agent-chat: agentInstance.inboxId** → `agentInstance.client?.inboxId` (Agent wraps client)
- **agent-chat: Module-level XMTP_DIR** → runtime `getXmtpDir()` in 4 files (stale on env change)
- **agent-chat: Router writeInbox** — Added error handling (disk full no longer crashes middleware)
- **agent-chat: CLI --name flag** — Greedy parsing fixed (stops at next -- flag)
- **agent-chat: Tier 2 hot path** — Cached rateLimit/piiCheck at module level (was re-importing every message)
- **agent-chat: startAgent** — Wrapped in try/catch with diagnostic error message

### Security
- COMMAND execution blocked at both protocol tier (tier 1/2) AND relationship (unknown/stranger)
- Outbound replies blocked for unknown peers (canReply enforcement in bridge)
- Path traversal sanitized in correlationId + atomic writes prevent partial corruption
- Handshake replay protection: 256-bit nonce, 90s freshness, 3 retry max per peer
- peers.json: chmod 600, atomic write with serialized flush lock
- PII scan: 0 findings, example addresses genericized in CLI help
- Cross-model audit: GLM-5 + Grok 4.2 + Claude Opus 4.6 (15 fixes, 3 false positives caught)

### Dependencies
- Zero new runtime dependencies (same as v0.1.0: @xmtp/agent-sdk, viem, uuid, xmtp-comms-guard peer)

## [2026.3.23] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **agent-chat skill v0.1.0**: Real-time XMTP E2E-encrypted messaging
  - Always-on daemon with `@xmtp/agent-sdk` v2.3.0
  - Filesystem bridge (outbox/inbox) for OpenClaw IPC
  - 3-policy consent system (open/handshake/strict)
  - Middleware chain: Consent → CommsGuard V6 → Router
  - Two-tier identity: 28 flavor canonical + per-user wallets
  - launchd (macOS) + systemd (Linux) service templates
  - CLI: status, health, groups, setup commands
  - 36-test suite (unit + adversarial, 114ms)

### Security
- **agent-chat router.mjs**: Path traversal vulnerability fixed — `correlationId` sanitized to `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` before inbox file write
- **agent-chat identity.mjs**: Runtime warning when wallet key length ≠ 66 (catches truncated keys)
- **agent-chat setup-identity.mjs**: Post-setup PII sanity check scans source files for leaked address

### Process
- Full SOP-001 pipeline: Research → Architecture (v2.3) → Code (Phases A/B/C) → Cross-model audit (Grok 4.2 + Claude 4.6) → Testing (36/36) → PII scan → Deploy → Ecosystem sync (30/31)

## [2026.3.22] - 2026-03-16

### Security
- **everclaw-wallet.mjs (Stage 2)**: Fix private key leak in `cmdSetup` — capture `keychainStore` return, fallback to encrypted file, banner shows actual backend
- **everclaw-wallet.mjs (Stage 3)**: Add simulation + rich confirmation to `cmdSwap` — shows amount in, expected out, min after slippage
- **everclaw-wallet.mjs (Stage 4)**: Add simulation + unlimited approval warning to `cmdApprove` — CRITICAL WARNING for `maxUint256` approvals
- **everclaw-wallet.mjs (Stage 5)**: Double confirmation for `export-key` — "YES I UNDERSTAND" exact match + 5-second countdown + Ctrl+C abort
- **everclaw-wallet.mjs (Dry-run)**: `--dry-run` flag gates `writeContract` calls in cmdSwap and cmdApprove; simulation + confirmation still execute

### Process
- Phase 2 Stages 2–5 + dry-run — audited by Claude 4.6, tested 7/7 PASS, PII scan PASS
- `isUnlimited` fix: uses `!amountStr` (not `=== "unlimited"` which would crash `parseEther`)

## [2026.3.21] - 2026-03-16

### Security
- **safe-transfer.mjs**: Add `simulateContract` before `writeContract` (catches reverts before gas spend)
- **safe-transfer.mjs**: Add interactive confirmation prompt before on-chain execution
- **safe-transfer.mjs**: Remove no-op signature packing code (dead variables `sortedSignature`, `encodedSignature`)
- **safe-transfer.mjs**: Replace `encodedSignature` with `signature` in writeContract args (fixes potential ReferenceError)
- **safe-transfer.mjs**: Replace hardcoded `gas: 200000n` with dynamic estimation (`gas: undefined`)

### Process
- Phase 2 Stage 1 — audited by Claude 4.6, tested 5/5 PASS, PII scan PASS
- SOP-001 pipeline with dedicated agents (Architect, Coder, Auditor, Tester, PII Checker, Deployer)

## [2026.3.20] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Comprehensive documentation suite** — 22 documents covering all aspects of EverClaw
  - Getting started: installation, quick-start, configuration
  - Features: inference, wallet, fallback, ollama, x402-payments, erc8004-registry
  - Scripts: overview and reference for 43 scripts
  - Operations: monitoring, three-shifts, troubleshooting
  - Reference: API, models, contracts, acquiring-mor, economics
  - Security: security overview, shield policy
- Total: 5,412 lines, 17,422 words, 596 KB

### Changed
- Docker image version bumped to 2026.3.20

---

## [2026.3.19] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **morpheus-proxy.mjs** — Model refresh was parsing router response incorrectly
  - Router returns `{ models: [...] }` but code expected raw array
  - Fix: `const data = JSON.parse(res.body.toString()); const models = Array.isArray(data) ? data : (data.models || []);`
  - Result: Model list now refreshes correctly, showing 40 models including GLM-5
  - Backwards compatible — handles both array and object formats

### Changed
- Docker image version bumped to 2026.3.19

---

## [2026.3.18] - 2026-03-15

### Security — Phase 1 Audit Hardening (morpheus-proxy.mjs)
- **CRITICAL: Auth bypass removed** — `PROXY_API_KEY` no longer defaults to `"morpheus-local"`. Proxy now requires a strong key via env var or exits on startup.
- **Cookie caching** — `getBasicAuth()` now caches the `.cookie` file read for 60 seconds instead of reading disk on every request. Cache invalidated on error.
- **Persistent sessions** — Sessions saved to `~/.morpheus/sessions.json` on every mutation (`set`/`delete`) and on graceful shutdown (SIGTERM/SIGINT). Loaded on startup. Proxy restarts no longer lose active sessions.
- **Rate limiting + body size protection** — New `securityMiddleware` runs before auth: 30 req/min per IP, 1MB body limit, smart cleanup at 800+ entries to prevent memory leaks.
- File grew from 833 → 924 lines. Zero new dependencies. All 36 existing tests pass.

### Fixed
- **morpheus-proxy.mjs** — Model refresh was parsing router response incorrectly
  - Router returns `{ models: [...] }` but code expected raw array
  - Fix: `const data = JSON.parse(res.body.toString()); const models = Array.isArray(data) ? data : (data.models || []);`
  - Result: Model list now refreshes correctly, showing 40 models including GLM-5
  - Backwards compatible — handles both array and object formats

---

## [2026.3.17] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- **install-with-deps.sh** — Complete zero-prompt rewrite (5-stage build)
  - `curl -fsSL https://get.everclaw.xyz | bash` now fully unattended
  - Hardware detection (RAM, disk, GPU) ported from setup-ollama.sh
  - All dependencies auto-install without prompts (Homebrew, Node.js, git, curl, OpenClaw)
  - EverClaw clone/update is automatic (no "Update? [y/N]" prompt)
  - Bootstrap key provisioned automatically (failure is non-fatal)
  - [REDACTED] proxy-router auto-installs when ≥2 GB disk free
  - Ollama local fallback auto-installs when ≥5 GB disk + ≥2 GB RAM
  - Config merge via setup.mjs --apply --restart runs automatically
  - Dashboard auto-opens after successful install (macOS/Linux)
  - Dynamic success banner shows installed components + inference chain
  - New flags: --skip-ollama, --skip-proxy (--auto-install now legacy no-op)
  - --check-only shows hardware stats + gating preview for all components
  - Zero `read -p` prompts in entire script (was 3)
  - PII scan clean, bash -n syntax verified

---

## [2026.3.15] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **setup-ollama.sh** — Hardware-aware local Ollama inference fallback
  - Auto-detects OS, CPU arch, total/available RAM, GPU (Apple Metal, NVIDIA CUDA, AMD ROCm)

## Contact File Format
```markdown
# Firstname Lastname

## Basics
- **Category:** family
- **Relationship:** Spouse / Friend / Colleague / etc.
- **First met:** YYYY-MM-DD or context
- **Last contact:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
[Background, how you know them, what they mean to you]

## Key Details
- Birthday: YYYY-MM-DD
- Location: City, State
- Phone: +1XXXXXXXXXX
- Email: name@example.com
- Social: @handle

## Family
- Spouse: ...
- Children: ...

## Interactions
### YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]
[What happened, key points, follow-ups]

## Notes
[Running notes, things to remember]
```

## Workflow
1. When asked about someone, search first
2. When adding new people, ask clarifying questions
3. After interactions, prompt to log them
4. Periodically suggest categorization updates
5. Respect privacy — never share contact info externally without permission

## Integration with Memory
- Contacts live in `memory/relationships/` for context persistence
- Key people may also be referenced in `MEMORY.md` for high-level context
- Daily notes in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` can reference contacts

## Privacy
- Contact files stay local
- Never sync to cloud or external services
- Malicious actors flagged in `bad_actors/` with caution notes

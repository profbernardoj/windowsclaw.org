# ♾️ Everclaw — AI Inference You Own, Forever Powering Your OpenClaw Agents

**Own your inference.** Everclaw connects your [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent to the [Morpheus](https://mor.org) decentralized inference network — giving you consistent, self-sovereign access to Kimi K2.5, GLM-4.7 Flash, Qwen3, and 10+ open-source models powered by staked MOR tokens that recycle back to you.

When your primary API credits run out, Everclaw kicks in automatically. Your agent stays online. No interruptions, no downtime, no surprise bills. And because MOR is staked — not spent — you maintain access for as long as you hold your tokens.

## Install

**From ClawHub:**

```bash
clawhub install everclaw-inference
```

**Or one-command installer:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profbernardoj/everclaw/main/scripts/install-everclaw.sh | bash
```

**Or manual clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/profbernardoj/everclaw.git ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw
```

> ⚠️ **Use `everclaw-inference`** — not `everclaw`. The bare `everclaw` slug on ClawHub belongs to a different, unrelated product ("Everclaw Vault"). See [CLAWHUB_WARNING.md](CLAWHUB_WARNING.md).

Then set up your wallet, proxy, and guardian:

```bash
# Step 1: Install the Morpheus proxy-router
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/install.sh

# Step 2: Create your wallet (stored in macOS Keychain — no external accounts)
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs setup

# Step 3: Send ETH to the wallet address shown above, then swap for MOR
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs swap eth 0.05

# Step 4: Approve MOR for staking
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs approve

# Step 5: Install the proxy and guardian (auto-starts on boot)
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/install-proxy.sh
```

That's it. Your agent now has a fallback inference provider that runs on decentralized infrastructure. No API keys, no external accounts, no subscriptions.

## Who Is This For?

**You don't need to be an engineer to use Everclaw.** If you can copy and paste commands, you can set this up.

Everclaw is built for early adopters who:

- **Run an OpenClaw agent on a Mac mini, laptop, or VPS** — and want it to stay online 24/7 without babysitting
- **Use AI daily for real work** — writing, research, analysis, communication — and can't afford downtime when API credits run out at 2 AM
- **Own or want to own MOR tokens** — and want to put them to work earning inference instead of sitting idle in a wallet
- **Care about decentralization** — you believe AI infrastructure shouldn't depend on a single company's API, and want a censorship-resistant fallback
- **Want their agent to handle crypto** — DeFi interactions, token management, wallet operations — and need the security to match the stakes

If you've ever had your AI assistant go dark because an API key expired or credits ran out, Everclaw solves that problem permanently.

## How It Works

1. **Get MOR tokens** on Base (swap from ETH or USDC)
2. **Stake MOR** to open an inference session (7 days by default)
3. **Your agent sends requests** through a local proxy that handles everything
4. **When the session ends**, your MOR comes back — stake it again
5. **Repeat forever** — MOR is recycled, not consumed

```
Your Agent → Everclaw Proxy (port 8083) → Morpheus P2P Network → AI Model
```

The proxy handles all the blockchain complexity: opening sessions, renewing before expiry, authenticating with the network, and routing requests. Your agent just talks to a standard OpenAI-compatible API.

## What's Included

### ♾️ Core — Decentralized Inference
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Morpheus Proxy Router** | Connects to the Morpheus P2P network and routes inference requests to providers |
| **OpenAI-Compatible Proxy** | Translates standard API calls into Morpheus format — any OpenAI client works |
| **Auto-Session Manager** | Opens 7-day blockchain sessions on demand, renews before expiry, recycles MOR |
| **Session Auto-Retry** | If a session expires mid-request, opens a fresh one and retries automatically (v0.5) |
| **Cooldown-Safe Errors** | Returns proper OpenAI error types so failover engines don't misclassify Morpheus errors as billing errors (v0.5) |
| **Model Router** | 3-tier local prompt classifier — routes simple tasks to GLM Flash, standard tasks to Kimi K2.5, complex tasks to Claude (v0.6) |
| **x402 Payment Client** | Automatic HTTP 402 payment handling — signs USDC on Base via EIP-712, with budget controls and dry-run mode (v0.7) |
| **ERC-8004 Agent Registry** | Discover agents on-chain — reads Identity + Reputation registries on Base, resolves registration files, checks trust signals (v0.7) |
| **API Gateway Bootstrap** | One-command setup for community-powered Morpheus inference — no API key, no wallet, no node required. New users get instant AI access (v0.8) |
| **Multi-Key Auth Rotation** | Configure multiple Venice API keys — OpenClaw rotates through them automatically when credits drain, keeping you on premium models longer (v0.9.1) |
| **Gateway Guardian v3** | Through-OpenClaw inference probes test the full stack (gateway → auth → provider → response). Circuit breaker kills sub-agents stuck >30 min burning credits. 4-stage self-healing with nuclear reinstall. Detects brain-dead agents, not just crashed processes (v0.9.3) |
| **MOR Swap Scripts** | Swap ETH or USDC for MOR tokens directly from the command line |

**Benefit:** Your agent gets persistent access to 30+ open-source models (Kimi K2.5, GLM-4.7 Flash, Qwen3, and more) that you own through staked MOR tokens. No API bills, no credit limits — stake once, use forever. MOR tokens are staked, not consumed — they're returned when sessions close and can be restaked indefinitely. The model router (v0.6) ensures you only use expensive models when you need to — cron jobs, heartbeats, and simple tasks run on Morpheus inference you own. The x402 client and agent registry (v0.7) let your agent discover and pay other agents on-chain. And with the API Gateway bootstrap (v0.8), new users get instant inference from their very first launch — no API key needed.

### 💸 Agent Economy — x402 Payments + ERC-8004 Registry
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **x402 Payment Client** | Automatic HTTP 402 payment handling — detects payment-required responses, signs USDC on Base via EIP-712, retries with payment |
| **Budget Controls** | Per-request max ($1 default) and daily spending limit ($10 default) prevent runaway payments |
| **ERC-8004 Agent Registry** | Discovers agents on Base via on-chain Identity (ERC-721) and Reputation registries |
| **Agent Discovery** | Full pipeline: identity → fetch registration file → check endpoints → check reputation scores |
| **Combined Flow** | Discover an agent on-chain → check its x402 support → make a paid API request — all programmatic |

**Benefit:** Your agent can discover other agents on-chain, verify their reputation, and pay them for services — all without custodial intermediaries. USDC payments are signed with EIP-712 and settled via the Coinbase facilitator. Budget controls prevent surprise spending.

### 🛡️ Gateway Guardian v3 — Self-Healing Agent
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **HTTP + Through-OpenClaw Inference Probes** | Checks gateway process AND actual inference capability every 2 minutes |
| **Full-Stack Health Check** | Uses `openclaw agent` with throwaway session to test gateway → auth → provider → response. Unlike v2's provider URL probes, this catches when auth profiles are disabled/cooldown |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Detects sub-agents stuck >30 min with repeated timeouts and triggers graceful restart to kill them |
| **macOS-Compatible Timeout** | Uses portable `perl alarm` instead of `timeout`/`gtimeout` for macOS compatibility |
| **4-Stage Restart Escalation** | Graceful restart → hard kill → kickstart → **nuclear reinstall** (`curl install.sh`) |
| **Signal Notification** | Notifies you via Signal before executing nuclear restart |
| **launchd Integration** | Survives reboots, auto-starts on macOS |

**Benefit:** Your agent recovers from crashes AND from provider cooldown cascades. v1 only detected crashes — v2 added provider health checks but couldn't see when OpenClaw's auth profiles were all disabled. v3 tests the full inference stack through OpenClaw itself. The circuit breaker kills stuck sub-agents that would otherwise burn through all your API keys. The nuclear option runs the same reinstall command you'd run manually as a last resort.

### 🔍 SkillGuard — Skill Security Scanner
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Pattern Scanner** | Detects credential theft, code injection, data exfiltration in skills |
| **Batch Audit** | Scan all installed skills at once |
| **ClawHub Scanner** | Check skills before installing from the public registry |

**Benefit:** Protects against the ClawHavoc-style supply chain attacks that target agents running on always-on machines. Scan before you install.

### 🔒 ClawdStrike — Security Auditor
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Config Audit** | Checks your OpenClaw configuration for security gaps |
| **Exposure Check** | Identifies network exposure, open ports, weak auth |
| **Report Generator** | Produces OK/VULNERABLE report with evidence and fixes |

**Benefit:** Know if your agent's front door is locked. Catches misconfigurations that could expose your wallet, messages, or files.

### 🧱 PromptGuard — Injection Defense
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Multi-Language Detection** | Catches injection attempts in English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese |
| **Severity Scoring** | Rates threats from low to critical |
| **HiveFence Network** | Shares threat intelligence with other agents for collective defense |

**Benefit:** When your agent processes messages from groups or untrusted sources, PromptGuard blocks attempts to manipulate it into revealing secrets or sending tokens.

### 💰 Bagman — Key Management
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Secure Storage Patterns** | Never store keys on disk — 1Password runtime injection |
| **Session Keys** | Ephemeral keys with limited permissions for daily operations |
| **Delegation Framework** | EIP-7710 integration for scoped agent authority |
| **Leak Prevention** | Patterns to detect and block accidental secret exposure |

**Benefit:** Your agent handles MOR tokens and private keys safely. The same security patterns used by professional custody solutions, adapted for AI agents.

## MOR Token Economics

MOR is **staked, not spent**. Here's how the economics work:

| Duration | MOR Staked | What Happens |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 hour | ~11 MOR | Returned after 1 hour |
| 1 day | ~274 MOR | Returned after 1 day |
| **7 days** | **~1,915 MOR** | **Returned after 7 days (default)** |

When a session ends, your MOR comes back. Open a new session with the same tokens. This is what makes the access yours forever — you're staking a refundable deposit for compute, not buying consumable API credits.

**Getting started:** 50–100 MOR is enough for daily use. Swap from ETH on Base using the included scripts.

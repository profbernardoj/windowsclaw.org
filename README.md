> **📢 Canonical repo: [profbernardoj/morpheus-skill](https://github.com/profbernardoj/morpheus-skill)** — EverClaw has been rebranded to **Morpheus Skill**. All development, issues, and PRs should target the canonical repo. This mirror is kept in sync automatically.

# ♾️ Morpheus Skill — AI Inference You Own, Forever Powering Your Agents

*Formerly EverClaw. Powered by the [Morpheus](https://mor.org) decentralized inference network.*

**Open-source first.** Everclaw connects your [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent to the [[REDACTED]](https://mor.org) decentralized inference network — putting open-source models like GLM-5 (Opus 4.5-level) front and center as your default, with Claude as a fallback only when needed.

Your agent runs on inference you own: GLM-5, GLM-4.7 Flash, Kimi K2.5, and 30+ models powered by staked MOR tokens that recycle back to you. No API bills, no credit limits, no surprise costs. MOR is staked — not spent — so you maintain access for as long as you hold your tokens.

> **New: [DIY Setup Guide](https://github.com/betterbrand/Mac-Mini-[REDACTED])** — Want to build an always-on [REDACTED] agent from scratch on a Mac mini? Complete walkthrough with identity separation, on-chain guardrails, three-tier inference fallback, and 9 documented gotchas. Every step tested on real hardware.

## Install

### One-Line Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.everclaw.xyz | bash
```

This guided installer:
- ✅ Checks for required dependencies (curl, git, Node.js, npm, Homebrew, OpenClaw)
- ✅ Auto-installs missing dependencies with real verification
- ✅ Works on **admin and non-admin macOS accounts** (nvm fallback for Node.js)
- ✅ Supports Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
- ✅ Clones EverClaw to the right location
- ✅ Bootstraps a **free GLM-5 starter key** (1,000 requests/day)
- ✅ Optionally installs the [REDACTED] proxy-router for P2P inference

### Other Install Methods

**From ClawHub:**

```bash
clawhub install everclaw-inference
```

**Manual clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EverClaw/EverClaw.git ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw
```

> ⚠️ **Use `everclaw-inference`** — not `everclaw`. The bare `everclaw` slug on ClawHub belongs to a different, unrelated product ("Everclaw Vault"). See [CLAWHUB_WARNING.md](CLAWHUB_WARNING.md).

### Prerequisites

The installer handles all of these automatically. Listed here for reference:

| Dependency | How to Install | Required For |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Homebrew** (macOS) | Auto-installed (admin required) | Package manager |
| **Node.js** (v18+) | Via Homebrew or nvm (non-admin fallback) | Bootstrap scripts, proxy |
| **Git** | Via Homebrew or Xcode CLI tools | Skill installation |
| **OpenClaw** | `npm install -g openclaw@latest` | Agent runtime |

> 💡 **Non-admin Mac?** The installer automatically detects non-admin accounts and uses [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js without requiring administrator privileges. No manual setup needed.

**Quick check:** Run `curl -fsSL https://get.everclaw.xyz | bash -s -- --check-only` to verify your environment.

### After Installation

Configure your OpenClaw agent:

```bash
# Easiest: Gateway only (no local proxy needed)
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/setup.mjs --template [REDACTED] --key YOUR_KEY --apply --test --restart

# Full: Local P2P + Gateway (auto-detects OS)
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/setup.mjs --key YOUR_KEY --apply --test --restart
```

Get your own API key at [app.mor.org](https://app.mor.org). Run without `--apply` first to preview changes.

**Want local P2P inference too?** Set up the wallet, proxy, and guardian:

```bash
# Step 1: Install the [REDACTED] proxy-router
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/install.sh

# Step 2: Create your wallet (stored in macOS Keychain — no external accounts)
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs setup

# Step 3: Send ETH to the wallet address shown above, then swap for MOR
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs swap eth 0.05

# Step 4: Approve MOR for staking (specify amount or use --unlimited)
node ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs approve 1000

# Step 5: Install the proxy and guardian (auto-starts on boot)
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/install-proxy.sh
```

That's it. Your agent now has decentralized inference — either via the API Gateway (instant) or local P2P (stake MOR for persistent access you own).

---

## Who Is This For?

**You don't need to be an engineer to use Everclaw.** If you can copy and paste commands, you can set this up.

Everclaw is built for early adopters who:

- **Run an OpenClaw agent on a Mac mini, laptop, or VPS** — and want it to stay online 24/7 without babysitting
- **Use AI daily for real work** — writing, research, analysis, communication — and can't afford downtime when API credits run out at 2 AM
- **Own or want to own MOR tokens** — and want to put them to work earning inference instead of sitting idle in a wallet
- **Care about decentralization** — you believe AI infrastructure shouldn't depend on a single company's API, and want a censorship-resistant fallback
- **Want their agent to handle crypto** — DeFi interactions, token management, wallet operations — and need the security to match the stakes

If you've ever had your AI assistant go dark because an API key expired or credits ran out, Everclaw solves that problem permanently.

---

## How It Works

1. **Get MOR tokens** on Base (swap from ETH or USDC)
2. **Stake MOR** to open an inference session (7 days by default)
3. **Your agent sends requests** through a local proxy that handles everything
4. **When the session ends**, your MOR comes back — stake it again
5. **Repeat forever** — MOR is recycled, not consumed

```
Your Agent → Everclaw Proxy (port 8083) → [REDACTED] P2P Network → AI Model
```

The proxy handles all the blockchain complexity: opening sessions, renewing before expiry, authenticating with the network, and routing requests. Your agent just talks to a standard OpenAI-compatible API.

---

## What's Included

### ♾️ Core — Decentralized Inference
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[REDACTED] Proxy Router** | Connects to the [REDACTED] P2P network and routes inference requests to providers |
| **OpenAI-Compatible Proxy** | Translates standard API calls into [REDACTED] format — any OpenAI client works |
| **Auto-Session Manager** | Opens 7-day blockchain sessions on demand, renews before expiry, recycles MOR |
| **Session Auto-Retry** | If a session expires mid-request, opens a fresh one and retries automatically (v0.5) |
| **Cooldown-Safe Errors** | Returns proper OpenAI error types so failover engines don't misclassify [REDACTED] errors as billing errors (v0.5) |
| **Model Router** | Open-source first 3-tier classifier — routes simple tasks to GLM Flash, standard + complex tasks to GLM-5, Claude fallback only (v0.9.8) |
| **x402 Payment Client** | Automatic HTTP 402 payment handling — signs USDC on Base via EIP-712, with budget controls and dry-run mode (v0.7) |
| **ERC-8004 Agent Registry** | Discover agents on-chain — reads Identity + Reputation registries on Base, resolves registration files, checks trust signals (v0.7) |
| **API Gateway Bootstrap** | One-command setup for community-powered [REDACTED] inference — no API key, no wallet, no node required. New users get instant AI access (v0.8) |
| **Multi-Key Auth Rotation** | Configure multiple Venice API keys — OpenClaw rotates through them automatically when credits drain, keeping you on premium models longer (v0.9.1) |
| **Gateway Guardian v5** | Direct curl inference probes — eliminates 71K prompt bloat and Signal spam. Billing-aware escalation, DIEM reset awareness, circuit breaker, 4-stage self-healing, proactive credit monitoring (v2026.2.21) |
| **Three-Shift Task Planning** | Morning/Afternoon/Night shift system — proposes prioritized task plans with approval workflow, shift-specific rules, handoff notes (v2026.2.21) |
| **MOR Swap Scripts** | Swap ETH or USDC for MOR tokens directly from the command line |

**Benefit:** Your agent runs on inference you own — GLM-5 (Opus 4.5-level), GLM-4.7 Flash, Kimi K2.5, and 30+ open-source models via staked MOR tokens. No API bills, no credit limits — stake once, use forever. MOR tokens are staked, not consumed — returned when sessions close and restaked indefinitely. The open-source first model router (v0.9.8) sends all tiers to [REDACTED] by default — Claude is only the escape hatch for tasks GLM-5 can't handle. Cron jobs, heartbeats, research, coding, and complex reasoning all run on inference you own. The x402 client and agent registry (v0.7) let your agent discover and pay other agents on-chain. And with the API Gateway bootstrap (v0.8), new users get instant inference from their very first launch — no API key needed.

### 💸 Agent Economy — x402 Payments + ERC-8004 Registry
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **x402 Payment Client** | Automatic HTTP 402 payment handling — detects payment-required responses, signs USDC on Base via EIP-712, retries with payment |
| **Budget Controls** | Per-request max ($1 default) and daily spending limit ($10 default) prevent runaway payments |
| **ERC-8004 Agent Registry** | Discovers agents on Base via on-chain Identity (ERC-721) and Reputation registries |
| **Agent Discovery** | Full pipeline: identity → fetch registration file → check endpoints → check reputation scores |
| **Combined Flow** | Discover an agent on-chain → check its x402 support → make a paid API request — all programmatic |

**Benefit:** Your agent can discover other agents on-chain, verify their reputation, and pay them for services — all without custodial intermediaries. USDC payments are signed with EIP-712 and settled via the Coinbase facilitator. Budget controls prevent surprise spending.

### 🛡️ Gateway Guardian v5 — Direct Probe Self-Healing
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Direct Curl Probes** | Probes [REDACTED]'s LiteLLM proxy directly with tiny prompt (~50 chars) — no more 71K workspace prompt bloat |
| **No Signal Spam** | Failures stay in logs only — no agent session means no accidental Signal message delivery |
| **Fast Lightweight Model** | Uses glm-4.7-flash for probes instead of glm-5 — faster, cheaper, purpose-built for health checks |
| **Billing-Aware Escalation** | Classifies errors as `billing` vs `transient` vs `timeout`. Billing → backs off + notifies (restart is useless). Transient → restarts as before |
| **DIEM Reset Awareness** | Calculates hours to midnight UTC (daily DIEM reset). Billing-dead → 30-min probe interval. Auto-clears on UTC day rollover |
| **Proactive Credit Monitoring** | Reads Venice DIEM balance from response headers. Warns when balance drops below threshold |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Detects sub-agents stuck >30 min with repeated timeouts and kills them |
| **Fixed Restart Chain** | No more `set -e` silent exits or pkill self-kill. ERR trap logs unexpected failures |
| **4-Stage Restart Escalation** | Graceful restart → hard kill (excludes own PID) → kickstart → **nuclear reinstall** |
| **Signal Notifications** | Notifies owner on: billing exhaustion (with ETA), billing recovery, nuclear restart, total failure |
| **launchd Integration** | Survives reboots, auto-starts on macOS |

**Benefit:** v4's `openclaw agent` probes injected the full 71K workspace system prompt into every health check, causing timeouts and delivering error messages to Signal as normal replies. v5 uses direct curl to the LiteLLM proxy with a tiny prompt — fast, silent, no side effects. Combined with billing-aware escalation from v4, your [REDACTED] self-heals reliably without spamming you.

### 📋 Three-Shift Task Planning — Structured Work Management
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Morning Shift (6 AM)** | Ramp-up: meetings, comms, decisions — front-loads tasks requiring user input |
| **Afternoon Shift (2 PM)** | Deep work: coding, writing, building — minimizes interruptions |
| **Night Shift (10 PM)** | Autonomous: research, maintenance, prep — no external actions without approval |
| **Priority Tiers** | P1 (must-do), P2 (should-do), P3 (could-do) — respects the 8-hour window |
| **Approval Workflow** | Nothing executes until the user approves, modifies, or skips |
| **Shift Handoff** | Each shift writes completion summary for the next shift to pick up |
| **Configurable Schedule** | Adjust times, skip weekends, set quiet hours — see config reference |

**Benefit:** Your agent proposes what to work on instead of waiting to be told. Three shifts cover 24 hours with clear boundaries — the morning shift handles human-interactive work, afternoon goes deep on building, and the night shift runs autonomously. Approval gates ensure nothing happens without your say-so.

### ⚡ Always-On Power Config — 24/7 Agent Operation
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Power Management Setup** | Configures macOS to never sleep — disables sleep, standby, hibernation |
| **Caffeinate LaunchAgent** | Background process prevents system sleep while running |
| **Power Nap + Wake on LAN** | Network activity works even with display off; remote wake enabled |
| **Auto-Restart** | System restarts automatically after power failure |
| **Restore Mode** | One command restores default power settings |

**Benefit:** Your agent needs your Mac to stay awake. Without this, cron jobs miss schedules, heartbeats don't fire, and long tasks fail mid-execution. With always-on configured, your agent is reachable 24/7, tasks complete uninterrupted, and cron jobs fire exactly when scheduled. Power cost is negligible (~$0.50-1/month for a Mac Mini M4 at idle).

### 🔍 SkillGuard — Skill Security Scanner
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Pattern Scanner** | Detects credential theft, code injection, data exfiltration in skills |
| **Batch Audit** | Scan all installed skills at once |
| **ClawHub Scanner** | Check skills before installing from the public registry |

**Benefit:** Protects against the ClawHavoc-style supply chain attacks that target agents running on always-on machines. Scan before you install.

### 🔒 ClawdStrike — Security Auditor
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Config Audit** | Checks your OpenClaw configuration for security gaps |
| **Exposure Check** | Identifies network exposure, open ports, weak auth |
| **Report Generator** | Produces OK/VULNERABLE report with evidence and fixes |

**Benefit:** Know if your agent's front door is locked. Catches misconfigurations that could expose your wallet, messages, or files.

### 🧱 PromptGuard — Injection Defense
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Multi-Language Detection** | Catches injection attempts in English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese |
| **Severity Scoring** | Rates threats from low to critical |
| **HiveFence Network** | Shares threat intelligence with other agents for collective defense |

**Benefit:** When your agent processes messages from groups or untrusted sources, PromptGuard blocks attempts to manipulate it into revealing secrets or sending tokens.

### 💰 Bagman — Key Management
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Secure Storage Patterns** | Never store keys on disk — 1Password runtime injection |
| **Session Keys** | Ephemeral keys with limited permissions for daily operations |
| **Delegation Framework** | EIP-7710 integration for scoped agent authority |
| **Leak Prevention** | Patterns to detect and block accidental secret exposure |

**Benefit:** Your agent handles MOR tokens and private keys safely. The same security patterns used by professional custody solutions, adapted for AI agents.

### 🧠 MemPalace — Enhanced Memory (Optional)
| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **ChromaDB Vector Search** | Semantic search across all memory files using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings |
| **Temporal Knowledge Graph** | Query entity relationships at specific points in time ("What did we know about X on date Y?") |
| **Obsidian Vault Export** | Export palace as browsable vault with frontmatter, wikilinks, MOCs, and timeline pages |
| **Dual Embedding Models** | Complements OpenClaw's built-in embeddinggemma-300m-qat — different models catch different semantic matches |
| **Migration Tool** | Idempotent one-time import of existing memory/*.md files into MemPalace |

**Benefit:** Your agent gets deeper memory recall across thousands of files. Two embedding models (300M + 22M params) searching independently means better coverage. The Obsidian export lets you browse and graph-visualize your agent's entire knowledge base. Requires `pip install mempalace` — EverClaw works without it.

## Available Models

| Model | Type | Router Tier | Notes |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| **GLM-5** | General | ⭐ STANDARD + HEAVY | **Default** — Opus 4.5-level reasoning, coding, and analysis. Open-source first. |
| **GLM 4.7 Flash** | Fast | LIGHT | Quick responses for trivial tasks — cron, heartbeats, simple lookups |
| **Kimi K2.5** | General | — | Solid general model, previous default |
| **Kimi K2 Thinking** | Reasoning | — | Extended thinking for complex problems |
| **GLM-5:web** | General + Web | — | GLM-5 with web search capability |
| **GLM 4.7** | General | — | Full GLM model |
| **Qwen3 235B** | General | — | Large parameter count |
| **GPT-OSS 120B** | General | — | OpenAI's open-source model |

All models are accessed through the same proxy endpoint. Switch models by changing the model name in your request.

**Why GLM-5?** Zhipu's 744B MoE model (40B active) matches Claude Opus 4.5 on benchmarks: 92.7% AIME 2026, 86% GPQA-Diamond, 50.4 Humanity's Last Exam (with tools). Industry-leading hallucination resistance. Handles reasoning, coding, structured output, and agentic tasks at frontier quality — all through [REDACTED] inference you own.

## MOR Token Economics

MOR is **staked, not spent**. Here's how the economics work:

| Duration | MOR Staked | What Happens |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 hour | ~11 MOR | Returned after 1 hour |
| 1 day | ~274 MOR | Returned after 1 day |
| **7 days** | **~1,915 MOR** | **Returned after 7 days (default)** |

When a session ends, your MOR comes back. Open a new session with the same tokens. This is what makes the access yours forever — you're staking a refundable deposit for compute, not buying consumable API credits.

**Getting started:** 50–100 MOR is enough for daily use. Swap from ETH on Base using the included scripts.

## Requirements

- **OpenClaw** — installed and running
- **Node.js** — v20+ (bundled with OpenClaw)
- **ETH or USDC on Base** — to swap for MOR tokens
- **macOS or Linux** — macOS Keychain or libsecret for native key storage; encrypted file fallback works everywhere
- **age, zstd, jq** — for backup/restore features (auto-installed by `install.sh`)
- **node-llama-cpp** — for local memory search embeddings (auto-installed by `setup.mjs` and `install.sh`)
- **mempalace** (optional) — `pip install mempalace` for enhanced ChromaDB + temporal KG memory. Not required — EverClaw works without it.

That's it. No external accounts. No API keys. No subscriptions.

### Wallet Security

Wallet keys are stored using the strongest available backend:

| Platform | Backend | Protection |
|----------|---------|------------|
| macOS | Keychain | Login password / Touch ID |
| Linux | libsecret (GNOME Keyring) | Desktop session |
| All | Encrypted file fallback | Argon2id passphrase (64 MiB, timeCost 4) |

The encrypted file fallback uses **AES-256-GCM** with keys derived from your passphrase via **Argon2id** (with scrypt as a secondary fallback). Legacy v1 files are automatically migrated on first access with a backup at `~/.everclaw/wallet.enc.bak`.

For Docker/CI, set `EVERCLAW_WALLET_PASSPHRASE` or `EVERCLAW_WALLET_PASSPHRASE_FILE` environment variables.

**Shell injection hardening (v2026.4.1.1712):** The `EVERCLAW_KEYCHAIN_ACCOUNT` and `EVERCLAW_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE` environment variables are validated at load time — only alphanumeric characters, dots, hyphens, and underscores are allowed. All keychain operations use `execFileSync` (array arguments) instead of shell strings, structurally eliminating shell injection even if validation were bypassed.

### Security Tiers

EverClaw configures OpenClaw's exec-approval system with one of three security presets:

| Tier | Emoji | What's auto-allowed | What's blocked |
|------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Low Security** | 🟢 | Read-only + dev tools (node, git, curl, etc.) | rm, docker, ssh, sudo, dd |
| **Recommended** | 🟡 | Same as Low + inline eval blocked | rm, docker, ssh, sudo, dd, python3 -c, node -e |
| **Maximum Protection** | 🔴 | Read-only only (ls, cat, grep, find, echo) | Everything else requires approval |

**All tiers** gate money operations (MOR approvals, ETH transfers, key export) at the application layer via `everclaw-wallet.mjs`.

**Set during install:**
```bash
node scripts/setup.mjs --apply --security-tier recommended
```

**Change after install:**
```bash
node scripts/security-tier.mjs --tier maximum --apply
```

**Check current tier:**
```bash
node scripts/security-tier.mjs --status
```

**Docker/CI:**
```bash
# Set via environment variable (defaults to 'recommended' when EVERCLAW_YES=1)
EVERCLAW_SECURITY_TIER=low|recommended|maximum
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "LLM request timed out" on first message

[REDACTED] Gateway models (GLM-5, gpt-oss-120b) can take 30-120 seconds on the **first request** while the P2P network discovers providers. This is normal and subsequent requests will be fast.

**Fix:** Ensure `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds` is at least 300 in your `openclaw.json`:
```json
"agents": {
  "defaults": {
    "timeoutSeconds": 300
  }
}
```

Running `node scripts/setup.mjs --apply` sets this automatically. You can also run `bash scripts/diagnose.sh` to check.

---

## Backup & Restore

EverClaw includes full disaster recovery and agent migration tools.

### Download Your Agent (Chat-Triggered)

Say "download my agent" in chat. Your agent will create an encrypted backup and give you a temporary download link with a passphrase. The link expires in 15 minutes and works once.

### Restore on a New Machine

```bash
# Native (macOS / Linux)
curl -fsSL https://get.everclaw.xyz/restore | bash

# Docker-to-Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.everclaw.xyz/restore | bash -s -- --docker
```

The restore script is self-contained — installs dependencies, decrypts the backup, adapts config for the new machine, sets up services, and verifies everything works.

### Manual Export

```bash
# Preview what will be exported
node scripts/agent-download.mjs --dry-run

# Create backup with wallet
node scripts/agent-download.mjs --include-wallet --wallet-address 0x...
```

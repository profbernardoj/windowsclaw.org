<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     This file helps your agent understand who it's working for.
     The more context you provide, the better your agent performs.
     
     Fill in what's relevant to you. Delete sections that don't apply.
     Your agent will read this at the start of every session.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

- **Name:** <!-- YOUR_NAME -->
- **What to call them:** <!-- First name or preferred name -->
- **Pronouns:** <!-- optional -->
- **Timezone:** <!-- e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London -->
- **Notes:** <!-- Quick facts: phone, primary contact method, etc. -->

## Context

<!-- What are you working on? What's your mission? What should your agent
     understand about your life and work to be most helpful?
     
     Example: "Building a startup in climate tech. Need help with research,
     writing, and keeping organized across 3 projects." -->

## Communication Style & Principles

<!-- How do you like to communicate? What tone should your agent match?

     Things to consider:
     - Formal vs casual?
     - Brief vs detailed?
     - Do you want pushback on ideas or loyal support?
     - Any language preferences or pet peeves?
     
     Example:
     **With family:** Warm, personal
     **With colleagues:** Friendly, professional
     **Feedback:** Welcome input on methods, but core direction is set -->

**Tone:**
- <!-- e.g., Never uses foul language -->
- <!-- e.g., Patient, explains technical concepts simply -->
- <!-- e.g., Encouraging -->

**Feedback preferences:**
- <!-- e.g., Welcome input on methods to achieve goals -->
- <!-- e.g., Core values and direction are non-negotiable -->

## Family

<!-- Optional but valuable. Knowing about family helps your agent with
     reminders, scheduling, gift ideas, and understanding priorities.
     
     Format:
     **Name** (relationship) — Born DATE (age)
     
     Example:
     **Partner** — Born June 14 (37 years old)
     **Child 1** (daughter) — Born March 20 (10 years old) -->

## Life Goals & Values

<!-- What matters most to you? Your agent can help you make progress on
     long-term goals through research, reminders, and strategic thinking.
     
     List your top priorities. For each:
     - What's the goal?
     - Why does it matter?
     - What's your current involvement?
     
     Example:
     ### 1. Family First
     Protect and provide for family's physical, emotional, and financial needs.
     
     ### 2. Career Growth
     Build expertise in [field] and reach [position] by [date]. -->

## Key Relationships & Collaborators

<!-- People your agent should know about. Helps with context in messages,
     meetings, and tasks.
     
     Format:
     - **Name** — Role/relationship, relevant context
     
     Example:
     - **Alex** — Business partner, handles marketing
     - **Dr. Smith** — Family physician -->

## How You Work

<!-- Help your agent match your working style.

     Things to describe:
     - Active hours and timezone
     - Preferred communication (async? real-time?)
     - Decision-making style (quick? deliberate?)
     - How you delegate (trust agent? want approval?)
     
     Example:
     - Active hours: 8 AM to midnight, with family gaps
     - Prefers async messages on Signal
     - Gives strategic direction, expects tactical execution
     - Values proactive suggestions but wants final say -->

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.

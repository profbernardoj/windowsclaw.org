READ shifts/state.json\n   - If status is NOT \"executing\": respond with exactly HEARTBEAT_OK (do nothing)\n   - If status IS \"executing\": continue\n\n2. READ shifts/tasks.md\n   - Find the FIRST step marked [ ] (not started)\n   - If no [ ] steps, check [!] (blocked) steps — retry if the blocker may have cleared\n   - If ALL steps are [x], [-], or [!] with 5+ retries: this shift is DONE → go to step 8\n\n3. READ shifts/context.md for rules, constraints, and known pitfalls\n\n4. CLAIM the step: Edit tasks.md, change [ ] to [~] for that step\n\n5. EXECUTE the step:\n   - Do EXACTLY what the step description says\n   - Stay within scope — do NOT drift to other tasks\n   - Max 3 tool calls for this step\n\n6. WRITE RESULTS back to tasks.md:\n   - Success: change [~] to [x] and append — DONE (cycle N): brief result\n   - Blocked: change [~] to [!] and append — BLOCKED (cycle N): reason\n\n7. UPDATE shifts/state.json: Increment cyclesRun, update counts, set lastCycleAt\n   UPDATE shifts/context.md if you learned something useful\n   DONE — respond with a one-line summary.\n\n8. SHIFT COMPLETE: Copy tasks.md to shifts/history/, write handoff.md, set status to completed.\n\nRULES:\n- NEVER take more than 2 steps per cycle\n- NEVER ask the user anything — if blocked, mark [!] and move on\n- Night shift: NO external comms, NO financial txns, NO destructive ops"
